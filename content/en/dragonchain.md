##What is Dragon Chain?

**Dragonchain was originally developed at Disneyâ€™s Seattle office** in 2015 and 2016 as the Disney Private Blockchain Platform. Over 20 use cases and applications were explored and documented 1 publicly via the W3C Blockchain Community Group . The platform was later released as open 2 source software under the Apache 2 license in October of 2016. 

**Dragonchain simplifies the integration of real business applications** onto a blockchain and provides features such as easy integration, protection of business data and operations, currency agnosticism, and multi-currency support.

The Dragonchain Foundation, a Non-Profit Corporation was created in January of 2017 to maintain ownership and responsibility of the open source code. The Dragonchain team is now in the process of launching a commercial entity to build a serverless architecture blockchain platform, and an incubator. 

The combination of serverless and blockchain technologies is unique and tremendously valuable.**The timing of the Dragonchain platform launch** is highly strategic to benefit from explosive growth of cloud computing over the last few years and the emerging wave of Blockchain solutions entering proof of concept stage across enterprises.
