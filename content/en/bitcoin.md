## Trading in virtual currency Bitcoin

Surely a whole range of you notice in last month an increased interest in the virtual currency bitcoin.  The purpose of this article isn't to describe the functioning of this virtual currency, we won't occupy with its history or with “bitcoin mining”, we won't give here bitcoins for free. This article is more focused on possibilities of its trading on the stock exchange, as an investment product, that goes currently through boom and its trading offers every day interesting investment opportunities.



### In short what is Bitcoin.

The digital currency Bitcoin created in 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto. I give just his definition, which is in my opinion easy to understand also for laymen. “The main uniqueness of bitcoin is its full decentralization; it's so projected, that nobody, neither the author nor other individuals, groups or governments won't be anyhow able to influence, damage, falsify, confiscate the accounts, control currency flow or cause the inflation. In the network doesn't exist any central point, anybody, who could decide about the network. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. The total number of money is final and it's known in advance, its release in the circulation is defined just by mathematical laws. The payments in the network are under way for minimum or any costs.”

### The value of Bitcoin as a currency

A whole range of experts naturally disputes long time over that, what create the value of this virtual currency. One of often repeated mistakes is that the value of the currency Bitcoin is directly given by the number of the users, who are Bitcoin mining. According to the theory should it also means, that the more users are Bitcoin mining, the higher is its value. Nevertheless it's just the other way around, the rising value of Bitcoin increases the number of miners, it follows that the users, that participate in the mining of this currency can't assess the real value. That's why they today hold the view, that the value of this currency is based just on the demand and the supply on the market and is so covered only by the confidence, that in the future it will be possible to pay with it just like today.

## Where to trade with Bitcoin
